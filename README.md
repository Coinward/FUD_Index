 FUD Index: Cryptoasset pegged to the volatility of bitcoin

Volatility measures the frequency and magnitude of price movements
that a financial instrument experiences over a certain period of time.
The more dramatic the price swings in that instrument, the higher the 
level of volatility. Volatility can be measured using actual historical
price changes as realized volatility, or it can be a measure of expected 
future volatility that is implied by exchange pricing and order book data. 

The FUD Index is the first benchmark index to measure the marketâ€™s expectation
of Bitcoin Volatility. It can be used as a barometer for market uncertainty, 
providing market participants with a measure of expected bitcoin price volatility.
